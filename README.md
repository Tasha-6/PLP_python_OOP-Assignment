# PLP_python_OOP-Assignment
Overview

This assignment demonstrates the use of:
          - Classes & Objects
          - Constructors (__init__)
          - Methods
          - Inheritance

Polymorphism
It is divided into two parts:

Student Class – Shows how to create a class with attributes and methods, initialize objects using a constructor, and access object data.

Faculty Classes – Demonstrates inheritance (child classes inheriting from a parent class) and polymorphism (different classes using the same method in different ways).
